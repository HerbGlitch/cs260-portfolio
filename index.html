        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a student currently learning as much as I can about programming as fast as I can. My hobbies include programming and martial arts. I am currently in the process of building my own computer from bits to a completed machine. I love to drone race (I am really bad at it) and 3D print. I am an avid Star Wars (Legends) fan, and I make costumes that I then wear to Fan X in Salt Lake. I have one older sister and two older brothers. We have been raised mostly in Provo, but each of us children have traveled to different places. I learned to play the saxophone during the span of high school. I enjoy most forms of electronic music. I enjoy reading and some of my favorite books are: "Halo: The Fall of Reach," "Darth Bane," and "The Martian Chronicles." I am a professional photographer, like my sister and brothers. I am also very experienced with Photoshop and am learning Illustrator. </p>

On your local machine, inside your portfolio directory, start a local web server to test your code. Later we will do this with webpack. For now, you can use this python command for Python 3:

python3 -m http.server

or this command for Python 2:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Both of these will open a web server that you can visit by going to localhost:8000 in a web browser. Test your web page to be sure it is working.

Create a repository on GitHub for this activity. I called my "portfolio". Don't check the box for adding a README file.
    *Review the git lesson pages before continuing

Inside of your portfolio directory, initialize a git repository with git init, add the GitHub repository as a remote, and push your code to GitHub. View your code on GitHub to be sure it is there.

git init
git add index.html
git commit -m "First commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:zappala/portfolio
git push -u origin master

Be sure to substitute your own username and repository name. 
*If you are using HTTPS (and NOT using SSH keys), then your GitHub links will look like this: https://github.com/zappala/gitpractice.git.
*If you are using SSH keys, then you github links will look like git@github.com:zappala/gitpractice.
*There is a small link in the Clone or Download dialog that lets you switch between these.

You are going to clone your git repository to your Digital Ocean server. Login to your DigitalOcean server with ssh and run this command:

mkdir ~/.ssh

Then, for the git clone to work without a password, the ssh keys you have on your local machine must also be on the remote machine. To do this, run this command from your local machine:

scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa* zappala@104.236.65.193:/home/zappala/.ssh/

Substitute your own username and IP address.

Next, use git clone to clone your GitHub repository into your home directory. This will be in /home/[your username].

You may need to run this command to give yourself ownership of the /var/www/html directory:

sudo chown -R [your username] /var/www/html

Now copy your index.html file to /var/www/html. Note, so that you have ownership of all the files in /var/www/html.

Visit your server in a browser, using the IP address of your DigitalOcean machine, to verify it works.

On your local machine, make some kind of a change to your index.html file. Commit and push the changes to GiHub. Login to your DigitalOcean server and pull these changes and then copy them to /var/www/html again. Reload your browser. Be sure this all works. This is your development workflow! We will be using this cycle regularly throughout the class.

Turn a screenshot of your web page, including the URL that shows it is on your Digital Ocean server. Congrats! -->
